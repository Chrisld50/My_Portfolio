# My_Portfolio

# User Story 
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

# Description
* I created my portfolio utilizing HTML and CSS.
* When an employer logs onto my portfolio, they will be given a page that shows color, a profile picture and links to different aspects about me.
* If an employer were to click on a link at the top they will be taken to the section of my portfolio that the link directs them to.
* If an employer were to click on a link at the bottom of my portfolio they will be given the ability to contact me by phone number, my linkedin or by my email. 
* The page also displays my projects that I have worked on and created, as well as my resume. 

# Technologies
