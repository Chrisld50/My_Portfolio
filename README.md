# My_Portfolio

# Description
My motivation for this project was to create my first portfolio! I wanted to show my abilities with CSS and HTML to create a responsive and tasteful portfolio site. Throughout this project I was able to learn a lot about how flex works when it comes to applying them to elements and make them shift to how I want them to be. The most difficult task for me is when I was shifting the headers away from the top of everything and getting them moved to the left side of my portfolio picturte and my work.
